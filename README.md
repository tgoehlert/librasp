librasp - version 0.1 (initial commit)

librasp is a library written in C++ that gives you
easy access to the I/O interfaces on your Raspberry Pi.

It can be extended and specialized for a wide range of purposes.

WARING:

This is a bloddy fresh project and is not ready for productive use yet.
Also keep in mind that the class and methodnames can be changed 
in this early stage of developement.
